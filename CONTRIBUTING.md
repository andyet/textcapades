# Contributing

This project is a labor of love by everyone involved, from the [author
who wrote the story)[https://twitter.com/Mike_Speegle] to the dev who
contributed that one character typo fix in that one comment.

With that in mind, please understand the following if you want to
contribute:

- Make sure there's an issue for what you're working on, and make a
  reasonable attempt to ensure nobody else is actively working on the
  same thing.
- If you are working on an issue, be sure to note that in the comments.
  Please also try to keep the issue updated so others can tell you're
  still working on it.
- You don't owe anybody your time.  If you are working on an issue and
  find that you need to drop it, give yourself permission to do so.
- Nobody owes you their time.  Please remember when making issues or
  commenting in them that this is a project everyone involved is working
  on in their already scarce free time.  Be patient, and courteous.
